# AnAddventure

A small web app that allows users to create collaborative [addventures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addventure), something like [Protagonize](http://www.protagonize.com/).

This is a pet project I did a while ago to learn web development. It used to be up and running, but I didn't see a purpose to keep it that way, so I turned it down.

I used Python 3.4 and the [Flask microframework](flask.pocoo.org) to make the app, and set up a NGINX 1.4 HTTP server and PostgreSQL 9.3 database to run it.
